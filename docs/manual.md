# User manual

This document describes how to use Parental Control for the Switch.

## Overlay

Interactions with the Parental Control are made thru the overlay.

First open the overlay using the combo defined in your Overlay manager.

### Main menu

When there are warnings they are shown at the top of the list:
```
ⓘ Database tampered! ---> Means that the database or settings data have been manually modified
ⓘ Database need upgrade! ---> Means that the database format has changed and you have to change a value in the admin section to upgrade it (for example reset your PIN to the same value).
```

Then when no game has been started, the menu shows:

```
No user / app started
Usage history
Admin
```

When a game has been started, the menu shows:

```
User: [username]
Playing: [game title]
Usage: 0 mn
Remaining: 1h 30 mn
Usage history
Admin
```

### Usage history

The usage history is divided into different sections showing statistics on the usage. *Currently only the current day usage is shown*.

When entering the menu, a submenu appears showing the list of all the users.

After selecting a user, the statistics appear:

```
Today
  Usage         1h 30mn
  Remaining     0h 0mn
```

### Admin menu

The admin menu is protected with a PIN.. The default PIN is `A A A A`.

```
Enabled                 Enabled
Working mode            Blocking
Notify remaining time   Activate
Log level               INFO
Set PIN
Set limits

Versions
  Overlay               v1.2
  Sysmodule             v1.2
```

- `Enabled` is a switch for enabling and disabling the parental control. When it disabled it does not count play time anymore.
- `Working mode` lets you define whether the system will be blocked at the end of play time or the play time is only shown on screen as a badge (Currently the only value is `Blocking`).
- `Notify remaining time` is a switch for enabling notifications about the remaining time. When enabled, a notification is shown every 15 minutes, and every minute during the last 5 minutes. **This feature is only available when Ultrahand overlay is used**.
- `Log level` lets you define the log level to DEBUG or INFO in the sysmodule and the overlay. Use DEBUG only when needed because it can generates big files.
- `Set PIN` opens a new menu for setting the Admin PIN (see [Admin PIN setup](#admin-pin-setup)).
- `Set limits` lets you define the play time limits (See [Setup limits](#setup-limits)).

#### Admin PIN setup

This screen lets you define a PIN for the Administrator of the Parental Control. The PIN can be defined with any pad button or combination.

#### Setup limits

Choose a user, then configure either `All games` or an installed game. Limits are tracked separately for every user and reset each local calendar day.

`All games` limits total play across all titles. A value of zero means unlimited. A per-game value of zero inherits the all-games limit. If both limits are configured, the first one reached is enforced.

Reaching a per-game limit closes only that game; other games remain available. Reaching the all-games limit uses the full timeout screen.
