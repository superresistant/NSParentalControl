## Installation

1. Install the required [**Tesla Menu**](https://switch.hacks.guide/homebrew/tesla-menu.html) or [**Ultrahand Overlay**](https://github.com/ppkantorski/Ultrahand-Overlay).

⚠️ If you want notifications you have to install **[Ultrahand Overlay](https://github.com/ppkantorski/Ultrahand-Overlay)**. Please look at its documentation to know how to install it and how to enable the notifications.

2. Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/TristanIsrael/NSParentalControl/releases/latest).

**The sysmodule is provided as a ZIP file which can be directly unzipped in the folder `/atmosphere/contents/`**

Here are the files and their destination:

| File | Destination | Description |
|--|--|--|
| exefs.nsp | /atmosphere/contents/4200000000003103 | The core of the system as a *sysmodule* |
| toolbox.json | /atmosphere/contents/4200000000003103 | A description file for Atmosphère |
| boot2.flag | /atmosphere/contents/4200000000003103/flags | Mandatory file to make the sysmodule start at boot |
| parental_control.ovl | /switch/.overlays | The overlay |

After copying the files, reboot the console.

## Build and install

This section explains how to create and install the binary for NS Parental Control.

### Architecture

This product relies on 2 components:
1 - a sysmodule that monitors the games usage and notifies when limit is reached. 
2 - an overlay that shows on demand information about the limits and permits setup of the limits.

The sysmodule and the overlay share a common database file. 

### Pre-requisistes for runtime

- Atmosphere installed
- Tesla menu installed or Ultrahand overlay for notification

### Pre-requisites for build

- Development computer with `devkitPro` and `devkitA64` (see below)
- `libnx` (Switch homebrew SDK) installed via devkitPto
- Atmosphere source code (see below)

### devkitPro and devkitA64 installation

Installation of devkitPro is described on [this page](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment).

### Build the sysmodule

Once the code is downloaded or cloned do the following:

Go to the directory `NSParentalControl/sysmodule`

Run the command `$ make`. At the end of the build, the `out.nosync` directory contains the file `exefs.nsp`.

This file should be copied in the directory `/atmosphere/contents/4200000000003103` of the SD card of the Switch.

### Build the overlay

Go to the directory `NSParentalControl/overlay`.

Run the command `$ make`. At the end of the compilation process, the directory contains a file name `parental_control.ovl`. 

Copy this file in the directory `/switch/.overlays/` in the SD card of the Switch.

### Auto-start Parental Control

In order for the parental control to load on startup you have to create a new folder named `flags` into `/atmosphere/contents/4200000000003103`. 

In this folder create an empty file named `boot2.flag`.
